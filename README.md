# Chatter Fixer
Chrome extension which attempts to display Salesforce Chatter attachments in the page, rather than making you download them.

This has barely been tested, and only on *.my.salesforce.com. My salesforce account only has access to Chatter, so I have no idea what it does to other salesforce pages.

# Installation
1. Download the zip file of this repository
1. Unzip it
1. In Chrome, open chrome://extensions/
1. Drag the unzipped folder into the chrome extensions window. This should install it.
1. Visit a Chatter page. You should now see larger image previews, and embedded video/audio players for multimedia attachments.

# Support
I have no plans to support or update this.
